critical digital humanities : the search for a methodology,"""can established humanities methods coexist with computational thinking? it is one of the major questions in humanities research today, as scholars increasingly adopt sophisticated data science for their work james e dobson explores the opportunities and complications faced by humanists in this new era though the study and interpretation of texts alongside sophisticated computational tools can serve scholarship, these methods cannot replace existing frameworks as dobson shows, ideas of scientific validity cannot easily nor should be adapted for humanities research because digital humanities, unlike science, lack a leading-edge horizon charting the frontiers of inquiry instead, the methods of digital humanities require a constant rereading at the same time, suspicious and critical readings of digital methodologies make it unwise for scholars to defer to computational methods humanists must examine the tools--including the assumptions that went into the codes and algorithms--and questions surrounding their own use of digital technology in research insightful and forward thinking, this book lays out a new path of humanistic inquiry that merges critical theory and computational science""-- provided by publisher","protocols, methods, and workflows: digital ways of reading -- can an algorithm be disturbed? machine learning, intrinsic criticism, and the digital humanities -- digital historicism and the historicity of digital texts -- the cultural significance of k-nn",['digital humanities'],"['digital humanities', 'science and the humanities', 'humanities', 'women in the humanities', 'humanists']",a,{'digital humanities': 1}
museum activism,"""only a decade ago, the notion that museums, galleries and heritage organisations might engage in activist practice, with explicit intent to act upon inequalities, injustices and environmental crises, was met with scepticism and often derision seeking to purposefully bring about social change was viewed by many within and beyond the museum community as inappropriately political and antithetical to fundamental professional values today, although the idea remains controversial, the way we think about the roles and responsibilities of museums as knowledge-based, social institutions is changing museums and activism examines the increasing significance of this activist trend in thinking and practice at this crucial time in the evolution of museum thinking and practice, this ground-breaking volume brings together more than fifty contributors working across six continents to explore, analyse and critically reflect upon the museum's relationship to activism including contributions from practitioners, artists, activists and researchers, this wide-ranging examination of new and divergent expressions of the inherent power of museums as forces for good, and as activists in civil society, aims to encourage further experimentation and enrich the debate in this nascent and uncertain field of museum practice museum activism elucidates the largely untapped potential for museums as key intellectual and civic resources to address inequalities, injustice and environmental challenges this makes the book essential reading for scholars and students of museum and heritage studies, gallery studies, arts and heritage management and politics it will be a source of inspiration to museum practitioners and museum leaders around the globe""-- provided by publisher","posterity has arrived: the necessary emergence of museum activism / robert r janes and richard sandell -- detoxing and decolonising museums / sara wajid and rachael minott -- growing an activist museum professional / elizabeth wood and sarah cole -- dividing issues and mission-driven activism: museum responses to migration policies and the refugee crisis / maria vlachou -- access as activism: bringing the museum to the people / catherine kudlick and edward m luby -- fossil fuel sponsorship and the contested museum: agency, accountability and arts activism / paula serafini and chris garrard -- the activist role of museum staff / victoria hollows -- from the ground up: grassroots social justice activism in american museums / laura-edythe s coleman and porchia moore -- spectacular defiance / julie mcnamara -- ""i'm gonna do something"": moving beyond talk in the museum / bernadette lynch -- feminism and the politics of friendship in the activist museum / viv golding -- memory exercises: activism, symbolic reparation, and non-repetition in colombia's national museum of memory / cristina lleras, michael andrés forero parra, lina díaz and jennifer carter -- auto agents: inclusive curatorship and its political potential / jade french -- museums as public forums for 21st century societies: a perspective from the national museums and monuments of zimbabwe / njabulo chipangura and happinos marufu -- museums in the climate emergency / steve lyons and kai bosworth -- activism, objects and dialogues: re-engaging african collections at the royal ontario museum / silvia forni, julie crooks and dominique fontaine -- museological activism and cultural citizenship: collecting the hong kong umbrella movement / selina ho and vivian ting -- museums in the age of intolerance / sharon heal -- activist practice through networks: a case study in museum connections / mercy mccann -- whose memories for which future?
