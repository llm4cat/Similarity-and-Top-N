elections and accountability in south africa,"this paper explores these different aspects of voter behaviour to assess whether elections can act as an effective accountability mechanism in south africa it finds that, while voters are willing to withdraw support from the incumbent party if they disapprove of its performance, they are unlikely to move their support to another party sanctioning government performance in the traditional sense is weak, making political accountability through elections more elusive paradoxically, the way in which political accountability currently manifests itself in the south african political system may actually lead to the entrenchment of one-party dominance, further reducing incentives for responsive and accountable governance by the incumbent party the paper concludes that in the south african context electoral accountability relies less on the notion of sanctions as a means to punish government instead, greater attention should be given to the method of 'selection' as a means to control politicians if this line of reasoning is adopted, elections can still act as an accountability mechanism and even as a sanctioning device an accountability relationship can therefore be established when voters regard elections as an opportunity to choose among parties to select the best possible party on offer",the south african electorate -- sanctioning government -- trends in voter participation -- voter registration -- voter turnout -- party identification -- the anc's partisan coalition -- government performance evaluations -- economic evaluations : evaluating the economy -- bivariate relationships : economic evaluations -- egocentric vs sociotropic economic evaluations -- retrospective vs prospective economic evaluations -- simple versus mediated retrospective economic evaluations -- general evaluations of direction of country and overall conditions -- summary -- political interest and awareness among voters -- variation in cognitive skills among south african voters -- dalton's typology : cognitive mobilisation and partisanship -- choosing among political parties -- the inclusiveness of political parties -- party images and partisanship -- inclusiveness : a sufficient of necessary condition for partisanship? -- the effects of exclusivity on partisanship -- the effects of ambiguity on partisanship -- the black african electorate -- party image evaluations and cognitive mobilisation -- summary -- conclusion : achieving accountability through elections?,"['elections', 'government accountability', 'party affiliation']","['government accountability', 'elections']",m,"{'elections': 2, 'government accountability': 1, 'party affiliation': 6}"

learning in a musical key : insight for theology in performative mode,"learning in a musical key examines the multidimensional problem of the relationship between music and theological education lisa hess argues that, in a delightful and baffling way, musical learning has the potential to significantly alter and inform our conception of the nature and process of theological learning in exploring this exciting intersection of musical learning and theological training, hess asks two probing questions first, what does learning from music in a performative mode require? classical modes of theological education often founder on a dichotomy between theologically musical and educational discourses it is extremely difficult for many to see how the perceivedly nonmusical learn from music is musicality a universally human potential? in exploring this question hess turns to the music-learning theory of edwin gordon, which explores music's unique mode of teaching/learning, its primarily aural-oral mode this challenge leads to the study's second question: how does a theologian, in the disciplinary sense, integrate a performative mode into critical discourse? tracking the critical movements of this problem, hess provides an inherited, transformational logic as a feasible path for integrating a performative mode into multidimensional learning this approach emerges as a distinctly relational, embodied, multidimensional, and non-correlational performative-mode theology that breaks new ground in the contemporary theological landscape as an implicitly trinitarian method, rooted in the relationality of god, this non-correlational method offers a practical theological contribution to the discipline of christian spirituality, newly claimed here as a discipline of transformative teaching/learning through the highly contextualized and self-implicated scholar into relationally formed communities, and ultimately into the world",hildegard of bingen and the letter to the prelates at mainz -- learning and conundrum of aptitude for the musical/non-musical -- how we learn music -- religious education and the challenges of learning in music -- learning in a musical key,"['music', 'theology', 'religious education', 'performative (philosophy)']","['music and philosophy', 'spirituality in music', 'contemporary christian musicians', 'bible in music', 'sacred music']",m,"{'music': 52, 'theology': 11, 'religious education': 44, 'performative (philosophy)': 12}"

jackets--and had he lived, television--for this purpose in addition to four chapters in which schoenberg illuminates 42 of his own compositions, the book begins with chapters on his development and
