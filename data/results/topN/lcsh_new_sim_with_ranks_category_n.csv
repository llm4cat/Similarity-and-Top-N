flowers of the renaissance,"from the sunflower in van dyck's self-portrait to roses scattered around botticelli's venus to columbines in the borders of fifteenth-century manuscripts, flowers grace many renaissance artworks their symbolic meanings, however, may be lost on the modern viewer this is the first book to untangle the richly layered botanical messages in many of the world's great masterpieces -- many favorite flowers, such as roses, irises, and lilies had long been endowed with a wealth of symbolic meanings renaissance artists, by embracing new methods of scientific observation, were able to portray them for the first time with an accuracy that made each species easily identifiable -- artists made conscious choices about the flowers they included in their work, for flowers and plants were still usually not the subject of a painting, but elements of a larger religious story influenced by the revival of classical ideals, artists frequently married religious symbolism with that from contemporary romances or classical mythology for example, the hortus conclusus or closed garden, traditionally a reference to the virgin mary, also became a symbol for the popular romance of the rose venus, in her purest aspect the goddess of love, was aligned with the virgin mary and, like her, often surrounded by roses or daisies garden pinks and carnations, meanwhile, did not figure in earlier traditions; during the renaissance they became part of the folklore of romance, and when held in a sitter's hands, they generally signified a marriage -- focusing on twenty popular flowers, including roses, lilies, irises, tulips, daisies, and poppies, the author discusses the history of cultivation of each variety before examining its symbolic meanings this delightful and beautifully illustrated book uncovers hidden treasures in the grass at a saint's feet, on the sleeve of an elizabethan lady, and inside the lid of a florentine wedding chest, allowing the reader to appreciate another facet of many of the renaissance's great artworks --book jacket",the renaissance garden -- roses -- lilies -- irises -- columbines -- pinks and carnations -- tulips -- poppies and peonies -- wallflowers and stocks -- something blue -- the flower-strewn grass -- the daisy family -- daffodils and narcissi -- violas and violets -- strawberries -- thistles,"['flowers in art', 'flowers', 'art, renaissance', 'art, european', 'art, european']","['flowers in art', 'art, early renaissance', 'floral decorations', 'flower arrangement', 'plants in art']",n,"{'flowers in art': 1, 'flowers': 32, 'art, renaissance': 12, 'art, european': 73}"

creating the future,"""conceived as a challenge to long-standing conventional wisdom, creating the future is a work of social history/cultural criticism that examines the premise that the progress of art in los angeles ceased during the 1970s--after the decline of the ferus gallery, the scattering of its stable of artists (robert irwin, ed kienholz, ed moses, ed rusha and others), and the economic struggles throughout the decade--and didn't resume until sometime around 1984 when mark tansey, alison saar, judy fiskin, carrie mae weems, david salle, manuel ocampo, among others became stars in an exploding art market however, this is far from the reality of the la art scene in the 1970s the passing of those fashionable 1960s-era icons, in fact, allowed the development of a chaotic array of outlandish and independent voices, marginalized communities, and energetic, sometimes bizarre visions that thrived during the stagnant 1970s fallon's narrative describes and celebrates, through twelve thematically arranged chapters, the wide range of intriguing artists and the world--not just the objects--they created he reveals the deeper, more culturally dynamic truth about a significant moment in american art history, presenting an alternative story of stubborn creativity in the face of widespread ignorance and misapprehension among the art cognoscenti, who dismissed the 1970s in los angeles as a time of dissipation and decline coming into being right before their eyes was an ardent local feminist art movement, which had lasting influence on the direction of art across the nation; an emerging chicano art movement, spreading chicano murals across los angeles and to other major cities; a new and more modern vision for the role and look of public art; a slow consolidation of local street sensibilities, car fetishism, gang and punk aesthetics into the earliest version of what would later become the ""lowbrow"" art movement; the subversive co-opting, in full view of pop art, of the values, aesthetics, and imagery of tinseltown by a number of young and innovative local artists who would go on to greater national renown; and a number of independent voices who, lacking the support structures of an art movement or artist cohort, pursued their brilliant artistic visions in near-isolation despite the lack of attention, these artists would later reemerge as visionary signposts to many later trends in art their work would prove more interesting, more lastingly influential, and vastly more important than ever imagined or expected by those who saw it or even by those who created it in 1970's los angeles creating the future is a visionary work that seeks to recapture this important decade and its influence on today's generation of artists ""-- provided by publisher","introduction : confusion, uncertainty, and the southern californian origins of art's postmodern plurality -- a dew line for the old culture : 1971, the ""art and technology"" exhibition, and the end of la's modernist daydreams -- the long march : the rise of women artists -- viva mi raza! : the rise of chicano artists -- a laminar flow at the edges : or, anger and dissent in the early 1970s art scene -- not an energy crisis : la's explosion in conceptual and performance art -- ""devil with a hammer and hell with a torch"" : how la's street culture inspired a new ""lowbrow"" art movement -- the horizontal city : public art in the landscape of la -- the mongols in the west : a trio of outsiders quietly subvert the la art world -- future shock : the birth of la's young romantics -- a last look at the ""la look"" -- epilogue : the lingering afterimage of la's art of the 1970s","['art and society', 'art, american']","['social movements in art', 'future in art', 'futurism (art)', 'hispanic americans in art', 'mexicans in art']",n,"{'art and society': 8, 'art, american': 200}"

picturing the apocalypse : the book of revelation in the arts over two millennia,"the book of revelation has been a source of continual fascination for nearly two thousand years concepts such as the lamb of god, the four horsemen, the seventh seal, the beasts and antichrist, the whore of babylon, armageddon, the millennium, the last judgement, the new jerusalem, and the ubiquitous angels of the apocalypse have captured the popular imagination one can hardly open a newspaper or click on a news site without reading about impending financial or climate-change armageddon, while the concept of the four horsemen pervades popular music, gaming, and satire yet few people know much about either the basic meaning or original context of these concepts or the multiplicity of different ways in which they have been interpreted by visual artists in particular the visual history of this most widely illustrated of all the biblical books deserves greater attention this book fills these gaps in a striking and original way by means of ten concise thematic chapters which explain the origins of these concepts from the book of revelation in an accessible way these explanations are augmented and developed via a carefully selected sample of the ways in which the concepts have been treated by artists through the centuries the 120 visual examples are drawn from a wide range of time periods and media including the ninth-century trier apocalypse, thirteenth-century anglo-norman apocalypse manuscripts such as the lambeth and trinity apocalypses, the fourteenth-century angers apocalypse tapestry, fifteenth-century apocalypse altarpieces by van eyck and memling, dürer and cranach's sixteenth-century apocalypse woodcuts, and more recently a range of works by william blake, jmw turner, max beckmann, as well as film posters and film stills, cartoons, and children's book illustrations the final chapter demonstrates the continuing resonance of all the themes in contemporary religious, political, and popular thinking, while throughout the book a contrast will be drawn between those readers of revelation who have seen it in terms of earthly revolutions in the here and now, and those who have adopted a more spiritual, other-worldly approach-- source other than the library of congress","1 the angel of the apocalypse: john's journey and his angelic guides -- 2 the lamb -- 3 the four horsemen -- 4 the seven seals: angelic destruction -- 5 the woman clothed with the sun -- 6 the satanic trinity -- 7 the whore of babylon -- 8 armageddon, the millennium, and the last judgement -- 9 the new jerusalem -- 10 the apocalypse in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: a survey of different approaches to revelation in the arts and popular culture",['apocalypse in art'],"['apocalypse in art', 'christian art and symbolism', 'disasters in art', 'christianity and art', 'symbolism in art']",n,{'apocalypse in art': 1}

geography, the science of surveying and the construction of fortification on dutch painting around 1650 the prelude to the project, developed at the university of trier, is pieter snayers' large-format depiction of historical battle scenes, in which maps and landscape paintings are projected over one another so as to document the most recent developments in modern engineering,

works, such as from the prado (madrid), the louvre (paris), the rijksmuseum (amsterdam) or the kunsthistorischen museum (vienna) testify to these new theses in pictorial science the new mapping of an
