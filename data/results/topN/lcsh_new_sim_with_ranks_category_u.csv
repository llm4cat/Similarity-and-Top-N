is the organizational culture of the us army congruent with the professional development of its senior level officer corps?,"""in the present study, dr pierce postulates that the ability of a professional organization to develop future leaders in a manner that perpetuates readiness to cope with future environmental and internal uncertainty depends on organizational culture specifically, the purpose of his study is to explore the relationship between the army's organizational culture and professional development he examines the degree of congruence between the army's organizational culture and the leadership and managerial skills of its officer corps senior leaders he uses data from a representative sample of such leaders while they were students at the army war college, classes of 2003 and 2004 at the macro level, the results of his research strongly suggest a significant lack of congruence between the us army's organizational culture and the results of its professional development programs for its future strategic leaders he bases his conclusion on empirical data that indicate that the future strategic leaders of the army believe that they operate on a day-to-day basis in an organization whose culture is characterized by: an overarching desire for stability and control, formal rules and policies, coordination and efficiency, goal and results oriented, and hard-driving competitiveness dr pierce recommends that the leaders of the army profession initiate an organizational culture change effort specifically, he recommends changes to the more informal aspects of the professional development program, such as the less than lifelong commitment to the army profession, the ""up or out"" personnel policy, and the officer evaluation system which may be creating an underlying assumption that failure will not be tolerated regardless of the circumstances those conditions all are representative of ""theories-in-use"" that are incongruent with the concept of professionalism as a result of the current culture, senior leaders may be exercising an excessive degree of structured supervision which reinforces the culture of stability and control, despite the formal education system which attempts to teach the opposite therefore, it is not surprising that junior professionals learn to distrust their senior leaders and to then subsequently perpetuate the cycle of over-control, or depart the profession altogether""--p iii-iv",summary -- introduction -- organizational culture -- importance of organizational culture analysis -- an overview of professional organizations --purpose of the present study -- brief discussion of the concepts of organizational culture and professionalism -- organizational culture -- professionalism and professional development -- methodology -- an overview of the competing values framework (cvf) model -- origins of the organizational culture assessment instrument (ocai) -- an overview of the management skills assessment instrument (msai) -- methodology of the study -- findings and analysis -- organizational culture assessment instrument (ocai) : findings and analysis -- final analysis -- implications -- overview -- implications for the army profession,"['corporate culture', 'organizational behavior', 'career development', 'employee retention']","['military discipline', 'military administration', 'military socialization', 'strategic culture', 'sociology, military']",u,"{'corporate culture': 14, 'organizational behavior': 6, 'career development': 58, 'employee retention': 77}"
