climate change and crops,"climate change is directly linked to the human activities, according to the fourth assessment report of ipcc (2007) in last two decades of 20th century, accelerated anthropogenic activities pushed up the atmospheric abundance of greenhouse gases, mainly co₂, ch₄, and n₂o, alarmingly which enhanced the radiative forcing of the earth's surface and thus perturbed its heat radiation balance as a consequence, atmospheric characteristics, such as temperature, rainfall pattern, levels of co₂ and o₃ have changed significantly, affecting the farm productivity although rising level of co₂ may have fertilizing effect on c₃ crops, but concomitant rise in atmospheric temperature, o₃ level and extreme weather conditions can not only nullify the fertilizing effect of co₂, but also drastically reduce the crop production, threatening food security to burgeoning world population agricultural crops are not only victim of climate variability and extreme whether conditions, but also serve as a potential source of ch₄ and n₂o therefore, in changed scenario, kyoto protocol (1997) has sought all signatory developed nations to cut down their emission levels as per their differential commitments to unfccc and developing nations to invest in less carbon emission projects to avert the process of global warming process in this context, the present edition, which compiles latest findings of studies carried out by the scientists on climate change and crops around the world, serves as a ready reckoner to crop scientists, atmospheric scientists, ecologists, environmentalists, research scholars and post- graduate students to update their knowledge and understanding on this issue -- book jacket","crop responses to elevated carbon dioxide and temperature -- climate change, climate variability and indian agriculture: impacts vulnerability and adaptation strategies -- simulation studies to characterize the impact of climate change on crop production and to identify strategies for adaptation and mitigation -- response of rice (oryza sativa l) to increasing temperature and atmospheric co₂ -- carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas fluxes from cropland soils -climate opportunities and threats -- greenhouse gases from crop fields -- environmental parameters influencing the methane emissions in the pantanal floodplain, brazil -- nitrous oxide emission from crop fields and its role in atmospheric radiative forcing -- quantifying direct n₂o emissions from paddy fields during rice growing season in mainland china in 1980s and 1990s -- impacts of ground-level ozone on crop production in a changing climate -- ozone-induced changes in plant secondary metabolism -- crop responses to enhanced uv-b -- physiological responses of higher plants to uv-b radiation -- possibility of water management for mitigating total emission of greenhouse gases from irrigated paddy fields -- mitigating greenhouse gas emission from agriculture -- attenuating methane emission from paddy fields","['crops and climate', 'climatic changes', 'crop yields', 'food supply']","['crops and climate', 'sustainable agriculture']",s,"{'crops and climate': 1, 'climatic changes': 20, 'crop yields': 15, 'food supply': 191}"

integrated mariculture : a global review,"while the concept and practice of integrated aquaculture is well-known in inland environments particularly in asia, in the marine environment, it has been much less reported however, in recent years the idea of integrated aquaculture has been often considered a mitigation approach against the excess nutrients/organic matter generated by intensive aquaculture activities particularly in marine waters in this context, integrated multitrophic aquaculture (imta) has emerged, where multitrophic refers to the explicit incorporation of species from different trophic positions or nutritional levels in the same system integrated marine aquaculture can cover a diverse range of co-culture/ farming practices, including imta, and even more specialized forms of integration such as mangrove planting with aquaculture, called aquasilviculture integrated mariculture has many benefits, among which bioremediation is one of the most relevant, and yet is not valued in its real social and economic potential although the present document provides some initial economic estimates for the integration benefits derived from bioremediation reducing risks is also an advantage and profitable aspect of farming multiple species in marine environments (as in freshwaters): a diversified product portfolio increases the resilience of the operation, for instance when facing changing prices for one of the farmed species or the accidental catastrophic destruction of a crop yet such perspectives are far from being considered in mariculture where, on the contrary, there is a tendency to monoculture modern integrated mariculture systems must be developed in order to assist sustainable expansion of the sector in coastal and marine ecosystems thus responding to the global increase for seafood demand but with a new paradigm of more efficient food production systems successful integrated mariculture operations must consider all relevant stakeholders into its development plan government, industry, academia, the general public and non-governmental organizations must work together and the role of integrated mariculture within integrated coastal zone management plans must be clearly defined there is a need to facilitate commercialization and promote effective legislation for the support and inclusion of integrated mariculture through adequate incentives particularly considering the reduction of environmental costs associated to monoculture farming bioremediation of fed aquaculture impacts through integrated aquaculture is a core benefit but the increase of production, more diverse and secure business, and larger profits should not be underestimated as additional advantages in many cases, more research is needed to further integrated mariculture - particularly regarding the technical implementation of a farm at this level, an important issue is to adopt adequate management practices that avoid or reduce the likelihood of disease transmission within and between aquaculture facilities or to the natural aquatic fauna also, careful consideration should be paid to the selection of species used in polyculture or integrated multitrophic aquaculture to reduce potential stress and suffering of culture individuals integrated aquaculture should be looked upon as a very important tool to facilitate the growth of marine aquaculture and promote sustainable development","integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (imta) in marine temperate waters / kelly barrington, thierry chopin and shawn robinson -- integrated marine and brackishwater aquaculture in tropical regions / max troell -- integrated aquaculture (intaq) as a tool for an ecosystem approach in the mediterranean sea / dror angel and shirra freeman","['mariculture', 'mariculture', 'sustainable aquaculture']","['sustainable aquaculture', 'aquaculture', 'aquacultural biotechnology', 'aquaculture industry', 'pond aquaculture']",s,"{'mariculture': 27, 'sustainable aquaculture': 1}"

evaluating the effectiveness of fish stock rebuilding plans in the united states,"""in the united states (us), the fishery conservation and management act of 1976, now known as the magnuson-stevens fishery conservation and management act (msfcma), was the first major legislation to regulate federal fisheries in the us fishery conservation zone (later designated as the us exclusive economic zone) the re-authorization of the msfcma passed by congress in 2006 included additional mandates for conserving and rebuilding fish stocks and strengthening the role of scientific advice in fisheries management approximately 20% of the fisheries that have been assessed are considered overfished according to the september 2012 stock status report to congress prepared by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) overfished refers to a stock that is below the minimum stock size threshold, commonly set to half the stock size at which maximum sustainable yield (msy) is achieved under the provisions of the msfcma, rebuilding plans for overfished stocks should take no more than 10 years, except when certain provisions apply rebuilding mandates have led to substantial reductions in catch and effort for many fisheries, raising concerns about the consequent social and economic impacts to the fishing communities and industry evaluating the effectiveness of fish stock rebuilding plans in the united states reviews the technical specifications that underlie current federally-implemented rebuilding plans, and the outcomes of those plans according to this report, fisheries management has evolved substantially since 1977 when the us extended its jurisdiction to 8 200 miles, in the direction of being more prescriptive and precautionary in terms of preventing overfishing and rebuilding overfished fisheries however, the trade-offs between precaution and yield have not been fully evaluated evaluating the effectiveness of fish stock rebuilding plans in the united states discusses the methods and criteria used to set target fishing mortality and biomass levels for rebuilding overfished stocks, and to determine the probability that a particular stock will rebuild by a certain date this report will be of interest to the fishing industry, ecology professionals, and members of congress as they debate the renewal of the magnuson-stevens fishery conservation and management act""-- publisher's description",introduction -- us fisheries management and the law -- review of federally implemented rebuilding plans -- technical considerations in developing rebuilding plans -- ecosystem considerations -- human dimensions of rebuilding -- looking forward -- appendix a: committee and staff biographies -- appendix b: list of acronyms -- appendix c: time series plots,"['fishery management', 'fishery management']","['fishery management', 'sustainable fisheries', 'fishery policy', 'fishery law and legislation', 'fish stock assessment']",s,{'fishery management': 1}

protecting paradise : 1080 and the fight to save new zealand's wildlife,"new zealand's native wildlife is in crisis it's being slaughtered by pests and we need to intervene more frequently, more comprehensively, and across a broader front than we currently are if we are to protect our mainland populations of our native wildlife the use of 1080 remains our best option to combat pests in the medium term as techniques have become more refined in recent years, the results from the aerial application of 1080 over significant areas of the conservation estate have been spectacularly successful in maintaining populations of native birds plus, it offers the best balance of environmental safety, affordability and effectiveness yet the use of 1080 attracts fierce opposition from a small group of vocal and passionate opponents this book examines their arguments, and conclusively shows that the 'science' put up by 1080 opponents is unsubstantiated the idea that our native forests are silent (ie that 1080 kills native birds) because of 1080 drops is also unsupported by research, while their other major claim that trapping could entirely replace 1080 is simply not practical dave hansford believes that opponents of 1080 who are concerned about the ethics of spreading poison across the land have a valid argument and should be given an audience he is however, deeply concerned by other vested interests, for example some in the hunting lobby who want more game animals to shoot, and are prepared to put that before the survival of our native wildlife he argues that it is time for new zealanders to take a stand, and to come to the defence of their wildlife if you care about our natural heritage, but are confused by the 1080 issue, then this is a book you must read, before kiwi and kereru and other iconic birds are a thing of the past on mainland new zealand",the first casualty -- the ark at the end of the world -- a plague upon our house -- what's your poison? -- an incriminating silence -- feeding the rat -- will nobody think of the little ones? -- death from above -- persistent fears -- rotten cherries -- respecting the maori -- the truth is out there -- craving approval -- there will be blood -- tipping the balance -- killing with kindness -- bones of contention -- the price of venison -- choose your weapon -- like spinning plates -- rambles in dystopia,"['pesticides and wildlife', 'sodium fluoroacetate', 'sodium fluoroacetate', 'pesticides', 'bird populations', 'wildlife refuges']","['pesticides and wildlife', 'wildlife management', 'wildlife conservation', 'wildlife rehabilitation', 'conservation biology']",s,"{'pesticides and wildlife': 1, 'sodium fluoroacetate': 829, 'pesticides': 95, 'bird populations': 17, 'wildlife refuges': 46}"

new england and northern new york forest ecosystem vulnerability assessment and synthesis : a report from the new england climate change response framework project,"forest ecosystems will face direct and indirect impacts from a changing climate over the 21st century this assessment evaluates the vulnerability of forest ecosystems across the new england region (connecticut, maine, massachusetts, new hampshire, northern new york, rhode island, and vermont) under a range of future climates we synthesized and summarized information on the contemporary landscape, provided information on past climate trends, and described a range of projected future climates this information was used to parameterize and run multiple vegetation impact models, which provided a range of potential vegetative responses to climate finally, we brought these results before a multidisciplinary panel of scientists and natural resource professionals familiar with the forests of this region to assess ecosystem vulnerability through a formal consensus-based expert elicitation process observed trends in climate over the historical record from 1901 through 2011 show that the mean annual temperature has increased across the region by 24 °f, with even greater warming during winter precipitation patterns also changed during this time, with a slight trend toward greater annual precipitation and a substantial increase in extreme precipitation events projected climate trends using downscaled global climate model data indicate a potential increase in mean annual temperature of 3 to 8 °f for the assessment area by 2100 projections for precipitation indicate an increase in fall and winter precipitation, and spring and summer precipitation projections vary by scenario we identified potential impacts on forests by incorporating these future climate projections into three forest impact models (distrib, linkages, and landis pro) model projections suggest that many northern and boreal species, including balsam fir, red spruce, and black spruce, may fare worse under future conditions, but other species may benefit from projected changes in climate published literature on climate impacts related to wildfire, invasive species, and forest pests and diseases also contributed to the overall determination of climate change vulnerability we assessed vulnerability for eight forest communities in the assessment area the assessment was conducted through a formal elicitation process with 20 scientists and resource managers from across the area, who considered vulnerability in terms of the potential impacts and the adaptive capacity for an individual community montane spruce-fir, low-elevation spruce-fir, and lowland mixed conifer forests were determined to be the most vulnerable communities central hardwoods, transition hardwoods, and pitch pine-scrub oak forests were perceived as having lower vulnerability to projected changes in climate these projected changes in climate and the associated impacts and vulnerabilities will have important implications for economically valuable timber species, forest-dependent animals and plants, recreation, and long-term natural resource planning",executive summary -- introduction -- current forest conditions -- observed climate change -- projected changes in climate and physical processes -- future climate change impacts on forests -- forest ecosystem vulnerabilities -- management implications -- appendix 1: common and scientific names of species mentioned in this -- appendix 2: historical climate data and trend analysis -- appendix 3: additional climate projections -- appendix 4: supplementary climate change tree atlas results -- appendix 5: supplementary linkages results -- appendix 6: supplementary landis pro results -- appendix 7: vulnerability and confidence determination -- appendix 8: future climate change impacts on biodiversity,"['climatic changes', 'forest ecology', 'forests and forestry']","['forest resilience', 'forest protection', 'forest meteorology', 'forest health', 'forest conservation']",s,"{'climatic changes': 11, 'forest ecology': 7, 'forests and forestry': 8}"
