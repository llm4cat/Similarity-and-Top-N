making the american century : essays on the political culture of twentieth century america,"""the twentieth century has been popularly seen as ""the american century,"" as publisher henry luce dubbed it, a long period in which the united states had amassed the economic resources, the political and military strength, and the moral prestige to assume global leadership by century's end, the trajectory of american politics, the sense of ever waxing federal power, and the nation's place in the world seemed less assured americans of many stripes came to contest the standard narratives of nation building and international hegemony that generations of historians dutifully charted in this volume, a group of distinguished junior and senior historians-including john mcgreevy, james campbell, elizabeth borgwardt, eric rauchway, elizabeth cobbs hoffman, and james kloppenberg-- revisit and revise many of the chestnuts of american political history first and foremost, the contributors challenge the teleological view of the inexorable transformation of the united states into a modern nation to be sure, chain stores replaced mom-and-pop businesses, interstate highways knit together once isolated regions, national media shaped debate from coast-to coast, and the irs, the epa, the federal reserve, the social security administration and other instruments of national power became daily presences in the lives of ordinary americans but the local and the parochial did not inexorably give way to the national and eventually to global integration instead, the contributors to this volume illustrate the ongoing dialectic between centrifugal and centripetal forces in the development of the twentieth century united states the essays analyze a host of ways in which local places are drawn into a wider polity and culture at the same time, they reveal how national and international structures and ideas repeatedly create new kinds of local movements and local energies the authors also challenge the tendency to view american politics as a series of conflicts between liberalism and conservatism, which arthur schlesinger, sr and jr codified as the idea that american national politics routinely experienced roughly fifteen year periods of liberal reform followed by similar intervals of conservative reaction for generations, american political history remained the story of reform, the rise and fall, triumphs and setbacks of successive waves of reformers--jacksonian democrats and abolitionists, populists and progressives, new dealers and great society poverty warriors-and, recently, equally rich scholarship has explored the origins and development of american conservatism the contributors do not treat the left and right as separate phenomena, as the dominant forces of different eras instead they assert the liberal and the conservative are always and essentially intertwined, mutually constituted and mutually constituting modern american liberalism operates amid tenacious, recurring forces that shape and delimit the landscape of social reform and political action just as conservatives layered their efforts over the cumulative achievements of twentieth century liberalism, necessarily accommodating themselves to shifts in the instruments of government, social mores and popular culture these essays also unravel a third traditional polarity in twentieth century us history, the apparent divide between foreign policy and domestic politics notwithstanding its proud anti-colonial heritage and its enduring skepticism about foreign entanglements, the united states has been and remains a robustly international (if not imperial) nation the authors in this volume--with many formative figures in the ongoing internationalization of american history represented among them--demonstrate that international connections (not only in the realm of diplomacy but also in matters of migration, commerce, and culture) have transformed domestic life in myriad ways and, in turn, that the american presence in the world has been shaped by its distinctive domestic political culture blurring the boundaries between political, cultural, and economic history, this collective volume aims to raise penetrating questions and challenge readers' understanding of the broader narrative of twentieth-century us history""--

us arms policies towards the shah's iran,"""this work reconstructs and explains the arms relationship that successive us administrations developed with the shah of iran from 1950 this relationship has generally been neglected in the extant literature leading to a series of omissions and distortions in the historical record by detailing how and why iran transitioned from a primitive military aid recipient in the 1950s to america's primary military credit customer in the late 1960s and 1970s, this book provides a detailed and original contribution to the understanding of a key cold war episode in us foreign policy by drawing on extensive declassified documents from more than 10 archives, the investigation demonstrates not only the importance of the arms relationship but also how it reflected, and contributed to, the wider evolution of us-iranian relations from a position of iranian client state dependency to a situation where the us became heavily leveraged to the shah for protection of the gulf and beyond -- until the policy met its disastrous end this work only study that deals directly and comprehensively with the entirety of us-iran arms relations during the reign of the shah the research posits that a failure to analyse arms issues in any detail has hindered any true understanding of us-iran relations prior to 1979, and has therefore omitted a key factor in the cold war geopolitics of the middle east adding this layer of analysis is not just historical, it provides insight into the major us cold war policy shifts that followed the iranian revolution - such as the carter doctrine and reagan's decision to go on the offensive against the soviet union put simply, those policies bore a direct relation to the failure of outsourcing containment in the middle east via arms sales and security relationships with allies such as the shah in that sense, arming iran was the grand test of the nixon doctrine and, it became its grand failure when iran descended into revolution in late 1978 and its people violently deposed the shah's regime, the very essence of us policy towards the entire gulf region imploded in that sense, although this monograph proceeds outwardly as a piece of diplomatic history, it is also written for those seeking better foundations for which to gain an understanding of us foreign policy in the final decade of the cold war, and beyond this work will be of interest to students and scholars of middle east studies, us foreign policy and security studies ""-- provided by publisher","american foreign policy towards the middle east, 1946-1968 -- building a client state : us military aid to iran, 1950-1963 -- lyndon b johnson and arms credit sales to iran -- richard nixon's revolution in us-iran arms sales policy -- gerald ford and iran : continuity in a testing climate -- jimmy carter and us-iran arms sales","['military assistance, american', 'arms transfers']","['nuclear arms control', 'international relations', 'cold war', 'military doctrine', 'nuclear disarmament']",e,"{'military assistance, american': 14, 'arms transfers': 50}"
